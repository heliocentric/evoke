## Description ##
Evoke is a small (50mb or less) live FreeBSD environment geared toward developers and system administrators, but we also include applications that the average user may find handy.

Our goal is to be able to run on older hardware, as well as modern machines, while providing a responsive system. We support both SMP and uniprocessor machines.
