`userconfig [commnd]`


== Description ==

Allow users to login, create a user account, and encrypt it via cryptofs and encfs if the user chooses.

== Commands ==

 * create
    Create a directory for a user, and set a password.
 * login
    Login as the user specified.
 * list
    List the users in the sysconfig directory.
 * menu
    Display a pretty menu for choosing the user.
 * logout
    Logout.

== Required Files ==

 * uuid - misc/ossp-uuid
    A uuid program that allows us to specify version 4 uuids (the uuidgen in base only supports version 1)
 * encfs - sysutils/fusefs-encfs
    Necessary, even though encrypting the userconfig data is optional
 * cryptofs - sysutils/fusefs-cryptofs
    Necessary, even though encrypting the userconfig data is optional
 * awk - base
    one-true-awk

== Implementation ==

Each user is stored in the sysconfig partition, in a directory named after the user's UUID. This was chosen to avoid the collisions inherent in using a login name, or an incrementing id number. Users may have the same login name, as long as their UUID is different, and even have the same real name (If you want, you can have 100 users in a sysconfig partition named 'John Smith', and nothing will break.).

The userconfig utility mirrors sysconfig, and has the added bonus of supporting transparent password based encryption via cryptofs or encfs. Note, that this is not 'remote login', as this will only encrypt the real 'keyring' data stored in the directory specified by N_CURUSER and soon, HOME (note, we may make them seperate, due to some assumptions made by processes using HOME, but N_CURUSER will always point to this directory).
