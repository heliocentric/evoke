# Main program. Note, we use random sha256 hashes, so that installer 
# can theoretically be run on a multi-user system
# Due to other reasons, it can't, but it's not /our/ fault.
# Not like we can unlink device nodes until we are done, 
# then relink it, causing exclusivity for our process and it's children.
# 
# Give the admin the option, and hope to hell they are smart enough not 
# to run installer on the same device nodes.
