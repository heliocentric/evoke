#summary 0.1 Release Notes
#labels Release

== Todo ==

 * installer needs to be able to install to a thumb drive.
 * 6.4 and 7.1 for i386 need to be on the image.
 * If installer can install to the thumb drive, we need an 'update' command that can automate finding boot filesystems, installing higher revisions/versions, and activating them.
    * the create-update script is capable of generating the bin updates, now all they need is a program capable of applying them.
    * the build.sh also needs to be able to push the bin-updates, should be trivial to add.

 * inline signing of the trackfile. (to secure the update mechanism). Remember the trackfile for the current system is loaded as an md device, is aligned, with a geom label trailer added. We need to make sure the signing system does not break this.
 * Target specific boot directory is not filled any more. This needs to be fixed before release, as installer will depend on it.
