===================================================================<br>
<br>
Lucent Public License Version 1.02<br>
<br>
THE ACCOMPANYING PROGRAM IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS PUBLIC<br>
LICENSE ("AGREEMENT"). ANY USE, REPRODUCTION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THE<br>
PROGRAM CONSTITUTES RECIPIENT'S ACCEPTANCE OF THIS AGREEMENT.<br>
<br>
1. DEFINITIONS<br>
<br>
"Contribution" means:<br>
<br>
a. in the case of Lucent Technologies Inc. ("LUCENT"), the Original<br>
Program, and<br>
b. in the case of each Contributor,<br>
<br>
i. changes to the Program, and<br>
ii. additions to the Program;<br>
<br>
where such changes and/or additions to the Program were added to the<br>
Program by such Contributor itself or anyone acting on such<br>
Contributor's behalf, and the Contributor explicitly consents, in<br>
accordance with Section 3C, to characterization of the changes and/or<br>
additions as Contributions.<br>
<br>
"Contributor" means LUCENT and any other entity that has Contributed a<br>
Contribution to the Program.<br>
<br>
"Distributor" means a Recipient that distributes the Program,<br>
modifications to the Program, or any part thereof.<br>
<br>
<br>
"Licensed Patents" mean patent claims licensable by a Contributor<br>
which are necessarily infringed by the use or sale of its Contribution<br>
alone or when combined with the Program.<br>
<br>
"Original Program" means the original version of the software<br>
accompanying this Agreement as released by LUCENT, including source<br>
code, object code and documentation, if any.<br>
<br>
"Program" means the Original Program and Contributions or any part<br>
thereof<br>
<br>
"Recipient" means anyone who receives the Program under this<br>
Agreement, including all Contributors.<br>
<br>
2. GRANT OF RIGHTS<br>
<br>
a. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby<br>
grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free copyright<br>
license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,<br>
publicly perform, distribute and sublicense the Contribution of such<br>
Contributor, if any, and such derivative works, in source code and<br>
object code form.<br>
<br>
b. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, each Contributor hereby<br>
grants Recipient a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent<br>
license under Licensed Patents to make, use, sell, offer to sell,<br>
import and otherwise transfer the Contribution of such Contributor, if<br>
any, in source code and object code form. The patent license granted<br>
by a Contributor shall also apply to the combination of the<br>
Contribution of that Contributor and the Program if, at the time the<br>
Contribution is added by the Contributor, such addition of the<br>
Contribution causes such combination to be covered by the Licensed<br>
Patents. The patent license granted by a Contributor shall not apply<br>
to (i) any other combinations which include the Contribution, nor to<br>
(ii) Contributions of other Contributors. No hardware per se is<br>
licensed hereunder.<br>
<br>
c. Recipient understands that although each Contributor grants the<br>
licenses to its Contributions set forth herein, no assurances are<br>
provided by any Contributor that the Program does not infringe the<br>
patent or other intellectual property rights of any other entity. Each<br>
Contributor disclaims any liability to Recipient for claims brought by<br>
any other entity based on infringement of intellectual property rights<br>
or otherwise. As a condition to exercising the rights and licenses<br>
granted hereunder, each Recipient hereby assumes sole responsibility<br>
to secure any other intellectual property rights needed, if any. For<br>
example, if a third party patent license is required to allow<br>
Recipient to distribute the Program, it is Recipient's responsibility<br>
to acquire that license before distributing the Program.<br>
<br>
d. Each Contributor represents that to its knowledge it has sufficient<br>
copyright rights in its Contribution, if any, to grant the copyright<br>
license set forth in this Agreement.<br>
<br>
3. REQUIREMENTS<br>
<br>
A. Distributor may choose to distribute the Program in any form under<br>
this Agreement or under its own license agreement, provided that:<br>
<br>
a. it complies with the terms and conditions of this Agreement;<br>
<br>
b. if the Program is distributed in source code or other tangible<br>
form, a copy of this Agreement or Distributor's own license agreement<br>
is included with each copy of the Program; and<br>
<br>
c. if distributed under Distributor's own license agreement, such<br>
license agreement:<br>
<br>
i. effectively disclaims on behalf of all Contributors all warranties<br>
and conditions, express and implied, including warranties or<br>
conditions of title and non-infringement, and implied warranties or<br>
conditions of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose;<br>
ii. effectively excludes on behalf of all Contributors all liability<br>
for damages, including direct, indirect, special, incidental and<br>
consequential damages, such as lost profits; and<br>
iii. states that any provisions which differ from this Agreement are<br>
offered by that Contributor alone and not by any other party.<br>
<br>
B. Each Distributor must include the following in a conspicuous<br>
location in the Program:<br>
<br>
Copyright (C) 2003, Lucent Technologies Inc. and others. All Rights<br>
Reserved.<br>
<br>
C. In addition, each Contributor must identify itself as the<br>
originator of its Contribution in a manner that reasonably allows<br>
subsequent Recipients to identify the originator of the Contribution.<br>
Also, each Contributor must agree that the additions and/or changes<br>
are intended to be a Contribution. Once a Contribution is contributed,<br>
it may not thereafter be revoked.<br>
<br>
4. COMMERCIAL DISTRIBUTION<br>
<br>
Commercial distributors of software may accept certain<br>
responsibilities with respect to end users, business partners and the<br>
like. While this license is intended to facilitate the commercial use<br>
of the Program, the Distributor who includes the Program in a<br>
commercial product offering should do so in a manner which does not<br>
create potential liability for Contributors. Therefore, if a<br>
Distributor includes the Program in a commercial product offering,<br>
such Distributor ("Commercial Distributor") hereby agrees to defend<br>
and indemnify every Contributor ("Indemnified Contributor") against<br>
any losses, damages and costs (collectively"Losses") arising from<br>
claims, lawsuits and other legal actions brought by a third party<br>
against the Indemnified Contributor to the extent caused by the acts<br>
or omissions of such Commercial Distributor in connection with its<br>
distribution of the Program in a commercial product offering. The<br>
obligations in this section do not apply to any claims or Losses<br>
relating to any actual or alleged intellectual property infringement.<br>
In order to qualify, an Indemnified Contributor must: a) promptly<br>
notify the Commercial Distributor in writing of such claim, and b)<br>
allow the Commercial Distributor to control, and cooperate with the<br>
Commercial Distributor in, the defense and any related settlement<br>
negotiations. The Indemnified Contributor may participate in any such<br>
claim at its own expense.<br>
<br>
For example, a Distributor might include the Program in a commercial<br>
product offering, Product X. That Distributor is then a Commercial<br>
Distributor. If that Commercial Distributor then makes performance<br>
claims, or offers warranties related to Product X, those performance<br>
claims and warranties are such Commercial Distributor's responsibility<br>
alone. Under this section, the Commercial Distributor would have to<br>
defend claims against the Contributors related to those performance<br>
claims and warranties, and if a court requires any Contributor to pay<br>
any damages as a result, the Commercial Distributor must pay those<br>
damages.<br>
<br>
5. NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE PROGRAM IS<br>
PROVIDED ON AN"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY<br>
KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY<br>
WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY<br>
OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Each Recipient is solely<br>
responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and<br>
distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its<br>
exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to<br>
the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable<br>
laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and<br>
unavailability or interruption of operations.<br>
<br>
6. DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY<br>
<br>
EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER RECIPIENT NOR<br>
ANY CONTRIBUTORS SHALL HAVE ANY LIABILITY FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,<br>
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING<br>
WITHOUT LIMITATION LOST PROFITS), HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF<br>
LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING<br>
NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OR<br>
DISTRIBUTION OF THE PROGRAM OR THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHTS GRANTED<br>
HEREUNDER, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
7. EXPORT CONTROL<br>
<br>
Recipient agrees that Recipient alone is responsible for compliance<br>
with the United States export administration regulations (and the<br>
export control laws and regulation of any other countries).<br>
<br>
8. GENERAL<br>
<br>
If any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable under<br>
applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of<br>
the remainder of the terms of this Agreement, and without further<br>
action by the parties hereto, such provision shall be reformed to the<br>
minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.<br>
<br>
If Recipient institutes patent litigation against a Contributor with<br>
respect to a patent applicable to software (including a cross-claim or<br>
counterclaim in a lawsuit), then any patent licenses granted by that<br>
Contributor to such Recipient under this Agreement shall terminate as<br>
of the date such litigation is filed. In addition, if Recipient<br>
institutes patent litigation against any entity (including a<br>
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Program<br>
itself (excluding combinations of the Program with other software or<br>
hardware) infringes such Recipient's patent(s), then such Recipient's<br>
rights granted under Section 2(b) shall terminate as of the date such<br>
litigation is filed.<br>
<br>
All Recipient's rights under this Agreement shall terminate if it<br>
fails to comply with any of the material terms or conditions of this<br>
Agreement and does not cure such failure in a reasonable period of<br>
time after becoming aware of such noncompliance. If all Recipient's<br>
rights under this Agreement terminate, Recipient agrees to cease use<br>
and distribution of the Program as soon as reasonably practicable.<br>
However, Recipient's obligations under this Agreement and any licenses<br>
granted by Recipient relating to the Program shall continue and<br>
survive.<br>
<br>
LUCENT may publish new versions (including revisions) of this<br>
Agreement from time to time. Each new version of the Agreement will be<br>
given a distinguishing version number. The Program (including<br>
Contributions) may always be distributed subject to the version of the<br>
Agreement under which it was received. In addition, after a new<br>
version of the Agreement is published, Contributor may elect to<br>
distribute the Program (including its Contributions) under the new<br>
version. No one other than LUCENT has the right to modify this<br>
Agreement. Except as expressly stated in Sections 2(a) and 2(b) above,<br>
Recipient receives no rights or licenses to the intellectual property<br>
of any Contributor under this Agreement, whether expressly, by<br>
implication, estoppel or otherwise. All rights in the Program not<br>
expressly granted under this Agreement are reserved.<br>
<br>
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of New York and<br>
the intellectual property laws of the United States of America. No<br>
party to this Agreement will bring a legal action under this Agreement<br>
more than one year after the cause of action arose. Each party waives<br>
its rights to a jury trial in any resulting litigation.<br>

<br>
This license establishes the terms under which a given free software<br>
Package may be copied, modified, distributed, and/or redistributed. The<br>
intent is that the Copyright Holder maintains some artistic control<br>
over the development of that Package while still keeping the Package<br>
available as open source and free software.<br>
<br>
You are always permitted to make arrangements wholly outside of this<br>
license directly with the Copyright Holder of a given Package. If the<br>
terms of this license do not permit the full use that you propose to<br>
make of the Package, you should contact the Copyright Holder and seek<br>
a different licensing arrangement.  Definitions<br>
<br>
"Copyright Holder" means the individual(s) or organization(s) named in<br>
the copyright notice for the entire Package.<br>

<br>
"You" and "your" means any person who would like to copy, distribute,<br>
or modify the Package.<br>
<br>
"Package" means the collection of files distributed by the Copyright<br>
Holder, and derivatives of that collection and/or of those files. A given<br>
Package may consist of either the Standard Version, or a Modified Version.<br>
<br>
"Distribute" means providing a copy of the Package or making it accessible<br>
to anyone else, or in the case of a company or organization, to others<br>
outside of your company or organization.<br>
<br>
"Distributor Fee" means any fee that you charge for Distributing this<br>
Package or providing support for this Package to another party. It does<br>
not mean licensing fees.<br>
<br>
"Standard Version" refers to the Package if it has not been modified,<br>
or has been modified only in ways explicitly requested by the Copyright<br>
Holder.<br>
<br>
"Modified Version" means the Package, if it has been changed, and such<br>
changes were not explicitly requested by the Copyright Holder.<br>
<br>

the Source form.  Permission for Use and Modification Without Distribution<br>
<br>
(1) You are permitted to use the Standard Version and create and use<br>
Modified Versions for any purpose without restriction, provided that you<br>
do not Distribute the Modified Version.  Permissions for Redistribution<br>
of the Standard Version<br>
<br>
(2) You may Distribute verbatim copies of the Source form of the Standard<br>
Version of this Package in any medium without restriction, either gratis<br>
or for a Distributor Fee, provided that you duplicate all of the original<br>
copyright notices and associated disclaimers. At your discretion, such<br>
verbatim copies may or may not include a Compiled form of the Package.<br>
<br>
(3) You may apply any bug fixes, portability changes, and other<br>
modifications made available from the Copyright Holder. The resulting<br>
Package will still be considered the Standard Version, and as such will<br>
be subject to the Original License.  Distribution of Modified Versions<br>
of the Package as Source<br>
<br>
(4) You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source (either gratis<br>
or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a Compiled form of the<br>
Modified Version) provided that you clearly document how it differs<br>
from the Standard Version, including, but not limited to, documenting<br>
any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and provided that<br>
you do at least ONE of the following:<br>
<br>
(a) make the Modified Version available to the Copyright Holder of the<br>
Standard Version, under the Original License, so that the Copyright Holder<br>
may include your modifications in the Standard Version.<br>
(b) ensure that installation of your Modified Version does not prevent the<br>
user installing or running the Standard Version. In addition, the Modified<br>
Version must bear a name that is different from the name of the Standard<br>
Version.<br>
(c) allow anyone who receives a copy of the Modified Version to make<br>
the Source form of the Modified Version available to others under<br>
(i) the Original License or<br>
(ii) a license that permits the licensee to freely copy, modify and<br>
redistribute the Modified Version using the same licensing terms that apply<br>
to the copy that the licensee received, and requires that the Source form of<br>
the Modified Version, and of any works derived from it, be made freely<br>
available in that license fees are prohibited but Distributor Fees are<br>
allowed.  Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version or Modified<br>
Versions without the Source<br>
<br>
(5) You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard Version without<br>
the Source, provided that you include complete instructions on how to<br>
get the Source of the Standard Version. Such instructions must be valid<br>
at the time of your distribution. If these instructions, at any time<br>
while you are carrying out such distribution, become invalid, you must<br>
provide new instructions on demand or cease further distribution. If<br>
you provide valid instructions or cease distribution within thirty days<br>
after you become aware that the instructions are invalid, then you do<br>
not forfeit any of your rights under this license.<br>
<br>
(6) You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled form without the<br>
Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 with respect to the<br>
Source of the Modified Version.  Aggregating or Linking the Package<br>
<br>
(7) You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard Version or<br>
Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute the resulting<br>
aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing fee for the<br>
Package. Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing fees for other<br>
components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms of this license<br>
apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or Modified Versions<br>
as included in the aggregation.<br>
<br>
(8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard Versions with other<br>
works, to embed the Package in a larger work of your own, or to build<br>
stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of applications that include the<br>
Package, and Distribute the result without restriction, provided the<br>
result does not expose a direct interface to the Package.  Items That<br>
are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version<br>
<br>
(9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and scripts) that<br>
merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by themselves, cause<br>
the Package to be a Modified Version. In addition, such works are not<br>
considered parts of the Package itself, and are not subject to the terms<br>
of this license.  General Provisions<br>
<br>
(10) Any use, modification, and distribution of the Standard or Modified<br>
Versions is governed by this Artistic License. By using, modifying or<br>
distributing the Package, you accept this license. Do not use, modify,<br>
or distribute the Package, if you do not accept this license.<br>
<br>
(11) If your Modified Version has been derived from a Modified Version<br>
made by someone other than you, you are nevertheless required to ensure<br>
that your Modified Version complies with the requirements of this license.<br>
<br>
(12) This license does not grant you the right to use any trademark,<br>
service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright Holder.<br>
<br>
(13) This license includes the non-exclusive, worldwide, free-of-charge<br>
patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import<br>
and otherwise transfer the Package with respect to any patent claims<br>
licensable by the Copyright Holder that are necessarily infringed by the<br>
Package. If you institute patent litigation (including a cross-claim or<br>
counterclaim) against any party alleging that the Package constitutes<br>
direct or contributory patent infringement, then this Artistic License<br>
to you shall terminate on the date that such litigation is filed.<br>
<br>
(14) Disclaimer of Warranty: THE PACKAGE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT<br>
HOLDER AND CONTRIBUTORS "AS IS' AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED<br>
WARRANTIES. THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A<br>
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED TO THE EXTENT<br>
PERMITTED BY YOUR LOCAL LAW. UNLESS REQUIRED BY LAW, NO COPYRIGHT HOLDER<br>
OR CONTRIBUTOR WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR<br>
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THE PACKAGE,<br>

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
Version 2, June 1991<br>
<br>
Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.<br>
59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA<br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
Preamble<br>
<br>
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your<br>
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free<br>
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This<br>
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software<br>
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to<br>
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by<br>
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it<br>
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it<br>
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid<br>
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.<br>
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you<br>
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.<br>
<br>
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that<br>
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the<br>
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their<br>
rights.<br>
<br>
We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and<br>
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,<br>
distribute and/or modify the software.<br>
<br>
Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain<br>
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free<br>
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we<br>
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so<br>
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original<br>
authors' reputations.<br>
<br>
Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software<br>
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free<br>
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the<br>
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any<br>
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.<br>
<br>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION<br>
<br>
0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains<br>
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed<br>
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,<br>
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"<br>
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:<br>
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,<br>
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another<br>
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in<br>
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".<br>
<br>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not<br>
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of<br>
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program<br>
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the<br>
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).<br>
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.<br>
<br>
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's<br>
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you<br>
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate<br>
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the<br>
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;<br>
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License<br>
along with the Program.<br>
<br>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and<br>
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.<br>
<br>
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion<br>
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and<br>
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1<br>
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices<br>
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.<br>
<br>
b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in<br>
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any<br>
part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third<br>
parties under the terms of this License.<br>
<br>
c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively<br>
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such<br>
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an<br>
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a<br>
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide<br>
a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under<br>
these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this<br>
License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but<br>
does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on<br>
the Program is not required to print an announcement.)<br>
<br>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If<br>
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,<br>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in<br>
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those<br>
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you<br>
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based<br>
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of<br>
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the<br>
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.<br>
<br>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest<br>
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to<br>
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or<br>
collective works based on the Program.<br>
<br>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program<br>
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of<br>
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under<br>
the scope of this License.<br>
<br>
3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,<br>
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of<br>
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:<br>
<br>
a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable<br>
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections<br>
1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three<br>
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your<br>
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete<br>
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be<br>
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium<br>
customarily used for software interchange; or,<br>
<br>
c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer<br>
to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is<br>
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you<br>
received the program in object code or executable form with such<br>
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)<br>
<br>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source<br>
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any<br>
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to<br>
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a<br>
special exception, the source code distributed need not include<br>
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary<br>
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the<br>
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component<br>
itself accompanies the executable.<br>
<br>
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering<br>
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent<br>
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as<br>
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not<br>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.<br>
L<br>
4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program<br>
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt<br>
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is<br>
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.<br>
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under<br>
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such<br>
parties remain in full compliance.<br>
<br>
5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not<br>
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or<br>
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are<br>
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by<br>
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the<br>
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and<br>
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying<br>
the Program or works based on it.<br>
<br>
6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the<br>
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the<br>
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to<br>
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further<br>
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.<br>
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent<br>
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),<br>
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot<br>
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you<br>
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent<br>
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by<br>
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then<br>
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to<br>
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.<br>
<br>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under<br>
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to<br>
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other<br>
circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any<br>
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any<br>
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the<br>
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is<br>
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made<br>
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed<br>
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that<br>
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing<br>
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot<br>
impose that choice.<br>
<br>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to<br>
be a consequence of the rest of this License.<br>
<br>
8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in<br>
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the<br>
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License<br>
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding<br>
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among<br>
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates<br>
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.<br>
<br>
9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions<br>
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program<br>
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any<br>
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions<br>
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free<br>
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of<br>
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.<br>
<br>
10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free<br>
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author<br>
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free<br>
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes<br>
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals<br>
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and<br>
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.<br>
<br>
NO WARRANTY<br>
<br>
11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY<br>
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN<br>
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<br>
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED<br>
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br>
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS<br>
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE<br>
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,<br>
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR<br>
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,<br>
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING<br>
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED<br>
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY<br>
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER<br>
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br>
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
Version 3, 29 June 2007<br>
<br>
Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/><br>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies<br>
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.<br>
<br>
Preamble<br>
<br>
The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for<br>
software and other kinds of works.<br>
<br>
The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed<br>
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,<br>
the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to<br>
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free<br>
software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the<br>
GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to<br>
any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.<br>
<br>
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not<br>
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you<br>
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for<br>
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you<br>
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new<br>
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.<br>
<br>
To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you<br>
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have<br>
certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if<br>
you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.<br>
<br>
For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether<br>
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same<br>
freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive<br>
or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they<br>
know their rights.<br>
<br>
Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:<br>
(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License<br>
giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.<br>
<br>
For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains<br>
that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and<br>
authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as<br>
changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to<br>
authors of previous versions.<br>
<br>
Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run<br>
modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer<br>
can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of<br>
protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic<br>
pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br>
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we<br>
have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those<br>
products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we<br>
stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions<br>
of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.<br>
<br>
Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.<br>
States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of<br>
software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to<br>
avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could<br>
make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that<br>
patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.<br>
<br>
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and<br>
modification follow.<br>
<br>
TERMS AND CONDITIONS<br>
<br>
0. Definitions.<br>
<br>
"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.<br>
<br>
"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br>
works, such as semiconductor masks.<br>
<br>
"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br>
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and<br>
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.<br>
<br>
To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work<br>
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an<br>
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the<br>
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.<br>
<br>
A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based<br>
on the Program.<br>
<br>
To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for<br>
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a<br>
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,<br>
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the<br>
public, and in some countries other activities as well.<br>
<br>
To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br>
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through<br>
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.<br>
<br>
An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"<br>
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible<br>
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)<br>
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the<br>
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the<br>
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If<br>
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br>
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.<br>
<br>
1. Source Code.<br>
<br>
The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work<br>
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source<br>
form of a work.<br>
<br>
A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official<br>
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of<br>
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that<br>
is widely used among developers working in that language.<br>
<br>
The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other<br>
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of<br>
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major<br>
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that<br>
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an<br>
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A<br>
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component<br>
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system<br>
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to<br>
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.<br>
<br>
The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all<br>
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable<br>
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to<br>
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's<br>
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free<br>
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but<br>
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source<br>
includes interface definition files associated with source files for<br>
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically<br>
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,<br>
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those<br>
subprograms and other parts of the work.<br>
<br>
The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users<br>
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding<br>
Source.<br>
<br>
The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that<br>
same work.<br>
<br>
2. Basic Permissions.<br>
<br>
All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of<br>
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated<br>
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited<br>
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a<br>
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its<br>
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your<br>
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.<br>
<br>
You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not<br>
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains<br>
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose<br>
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you<br>
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with<br>
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do<br>
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works<br>
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction<br>
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of<br>
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.<br>
<br>
Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under<br>
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10<br>
makes it unnecessary.<br>
<br>
3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.<br>
<br>
No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological<br>
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article<br>
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or<br>
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such<br>
measures.<br>
<br>
When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid<br>
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention<br>
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to<br>
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or<br>
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's<br>
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of<br>
technological measures.<br>
<br>
4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.<br>
<br>
You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you<br>
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and<br>
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;<br>
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any<br>
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;<br>
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all<br>
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.<br>
<br>
You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,<br>
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.<br>
<br>
5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.<br>
<br>
You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to<br>
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the<br>
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:<br>
<br>
a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified<br>
it, and giving a relevant date.<br>
<br>
b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is<br>
released under this License and any conditions added under section<br>
7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to<br>
"keep intact all notices".<br>
<br>
c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this<br>
License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This<br>
License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7<br>
additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br>
regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no<br>
permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not<br>
invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.<br>
<br>
d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display<br>
Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive<br>
interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your<br>
work need not make them do so.<br>
<br>
A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent<br>
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,<br>
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,<br>
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an<br>
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not<br>
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<br>
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work<br>
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other<br>
parts of the aggregate.<br>
<br>
6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.<br>
<br>
You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms<br>
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the<br>
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,<br>
in one of these ways:<br>
<br>
a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the<br>
Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium<br>
customarily used for software interchange.<br>
<br>
b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product<br>
(including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a<br>
written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as<br>
long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product<br>
model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a<br>
copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the<br>
product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical<br>
medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no<br>
more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this<br>
conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the<br>
Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.<br>
<br>
c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the<br>
written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This<br>
alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and<br>
only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord<br>
with subsection 6b.<br>
<br>
d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated<br>
place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the<br>
Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no<br>
further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the<br>
Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to<br>
copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source<br>
may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)<br>
that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain<br>
clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the<br>
Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the<br>
Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is<br>
available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.<br>
<br>
e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided<br>
you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding<br>
Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no<br>
charge under subsection 6d.<br>
<br>
A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded<br>
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be<br>
included in conveying the object code work.<br>
<br>
A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any<br>
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,<br>
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation<br>
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,<br>
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular<br>
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a<br>
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status<br>
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user<br>
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product<br>
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial<br>
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br>
the only significant mode of use of the product.<br>
<br>
"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,<br>
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install<br>
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from<br>
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must<br>
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object<br>
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because<br>
modification has been made.<br>
<br>
If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or<br>
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as<br>
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the<br>
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a<br>
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the<br>
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied<br>
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply<br>
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install<br>
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has<br>
been installed in ROM).<br>
<br>
The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a<br>
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates<br>
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for<br>
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a<br>
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and<br>
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and<br>
protocols for communication across the network.<br>
<br>
Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,<br>
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly<br>
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in<br>
source code form), and must require no special password or key for<br>
unpacking, reading or copying.<br>
<br>
7. Additional Terms.<br>
<br>
"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this<br>
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.<br>
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall<br>
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent<br>
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions<br>
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately<br>
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br>
this License without regard to the additional permissions.<br>
<br>
When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option<br>
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of<br>
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own<br>
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place<br>
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,<br>
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.<br>
<br>
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you<br>
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of<br>
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:<br>
<br>
a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the<br>
terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or<br>
<br>
b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or<br>
author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal<br>
Notices displayed by works containing it; or<br>
<br>
c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or<br>
requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in<br>
reasonable ways as different from the original version; or<br>
<br>
d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or<br>
authors of the material; or<br>
<br>
e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some<br>
trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or<br>
<br>
f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that<br>
material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of<br>
it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for<br>
any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on<br>
those licensors and authors.<br>
<br>
All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further<br>
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you<br>
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is<br>
governed by this License along with a term that is a further<br>
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains<br>
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this<br>
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms<br>
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does<br>
not survive such relicensing or conveying.<br>
<br>
If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you<br>
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the<br>
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating<br>
where to find the applicable terms.<br>
<br>
Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the<br>
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;<br>
the above requirements apply either way.<br>
<br>
8. Termination.<br>
<br>
You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly<br>
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or<br>
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under<br>
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third<br>
paragraph of section 11).<br>
<br>
However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your<br>
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)<br>
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and<br>
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright<br>
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br>
prior to 60 days after the cessation.<br>
<br>
Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is<br>
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the<br>
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have<br>
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that<br>
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br>
your receipt of the notice.<br>
<br>
Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the<br>
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under<br>
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently<br>
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same<br>
material under section 10.<br>
<br>
9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.<br>
<br>
You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or<br>
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work<br>
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission<br>
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,<br>
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or<br>
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do<br>
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a<br>
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.<br>
<br>
10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.<br>
<br>
Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically<br>
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and<br>
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible<br>
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.<br>
<br>
An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an<br>
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an<br>
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered<br>
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that<br>
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever<br>
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could<br>
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br>
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if<br>
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.<br>
<br>
You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the<br>
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may<br>
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of<br>
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation<br>
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that<br>
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for<br>
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.<br>
<br>
11. Patents.<br>
<br>
A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br>
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The<br>
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".<br>
<br>
A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims<br>
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or<br>
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted<br>
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,<br>
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a<br>
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For<br>
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant<br>
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of<br>
this License.<br>
<br>
Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free<br>
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to<br>
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and<br>
propagate the contents of its contributor version.<br>
<br>
In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express<br>
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent<br>
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to<br>
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a<br>
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a<br>
patent against the party.<br>
<br>
If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,<br>
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone<br>
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a<br>
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,<br>
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so<br>
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br>
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner<br>
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent<br>
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have<br>
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the<br>
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work<br>
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that<br>
country that you have reason to believe are valid.<br>
<br>
If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or<br>
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a<br>
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties<br>
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify<br>
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license<br>
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered<br>
work and works based on it.<br>
<br>
A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within<br>
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is<br>
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are<br>
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered<br>
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is<br>
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment<br>
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying<br>
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the<br>
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory<br>
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work<br>
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily<br>
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that<br>
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,<br>
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.<br>
<br>
Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting<br>
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may<br>
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.<br>
<br>
12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.<br>
<br>
If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or<br>
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not<br>
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a<br>
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this<br>
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may<br>
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you<br>
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey<br>
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this<br>
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.<br>
<br>
13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.<br>
<br>
Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have<br>
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed<br>
under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single<br>
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this<br>
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,<br>
but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,<br>
section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the<br>
combination as such.<br>
<br>
14. Revised Versions of this License.<br>
<br>
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of<br>
the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will<br>
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to<br>
address new problems or concerns.<br>
<br>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the<br>
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General<br>
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the<br>
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered<br>
version or of any later version published by the Free Software<br>
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the<br>
GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published<br>
by the Free Software Foundation.<br>
<br>
If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future<br>
versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's<br>
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you<br>
to choose that version for the Program.<br>
<br>
Later license versions may give you additional or different<br>
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any<br>
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a<br>
later version.<br>
<br>
15. Disclaimer of Warranty.<br>
<br>
THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY<br>
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT<br>
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY<br>
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,<br>
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM<br>
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF<br>
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.<br>
<br>
16. Limitation of Liability.<br>
<br>
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING<br>
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS<br>
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY<br>
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE<br>
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF<br>
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD<br>
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),<br>
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF<br>
SUCH DAMAGES.<br>
<br>
17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.<br>
<br>
If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided<br>
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,<br>
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates<br>
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the<br>
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a<br>
copy of the Program in return for a fee.<br>
<br>

<br>
3. Distribution Obligations.<br>
<br>
3.1. Availability of Source Code.<br>
<br>
Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make<br>
available in Executable form must also be made available in Source<br>
Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under<br>
the terms of this License.  You must include a copy of this<br>
License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered<br>
Software You distribute or otherwise make available.  You must<br>
inform recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form<br>
as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code<br>
form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily<br>
used for software exchange.<br>
<br>
3.2. Modifications.<br>
<br>
The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are<br>
governed by the terms of this License.  You represent that You<br>
believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or<br>
You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this<br>
License.<br>
<br>
3.3. Required Notices.<br>
<br>
You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that<br>
identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification.  You may<br>
not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices<br>
contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing<br>
or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or<br>
the Initial Developer.<br>
<br>
3.4. Application of Additional Terms.<br>
<br>
You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in<br>
Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version<br>
of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder.  You may<br>
choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,<br>
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of<br>
Covered Software.  However, you may do so only on Your own behalf,<br>
and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.<br>
You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,<br>
indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You<br>
hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every<br>
Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or<br>
such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or<br>
liability terms You offer.<br>
<br>
3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.<br>
<br>
You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software<br>
under the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of<br>
Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License,<br>
provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License<br>
and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to<br>
limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from<br>
the rights set forth in this License.  If You distribute the<br>
Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You<br>
must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from<br>
this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial<br>
Developer or Contributor.  You hereby agree to indemnify the<br>
Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred<br>
by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any<br>
such terms You offer.<br>
<br>
3.6. Larger Works.<br>
<br>
You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with<br>
other code not governed by the terms of this License and<br>
distribute the Larger Work as a single product.  In such a case,<br>
You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled<br>
for the Covered Software.<br>
<br>
4. Versions of the License.<br>
<br>
4.1. New Versions.<br>
<br>
Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may<br>
publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to<br>
time.  Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.<br>
Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license<br>
steward has the right to modify this License.<br>
<br>
4.2. Effect of New Versions.<br>
<br>
You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the<br>
Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the<br>
License under which You originally received the Covered Software.<br>
If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original<br>
Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made<br>
available under any subsequent version of the License, You must<br>
distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms<br>
of the version of the License under which You originally received<br>
the Covered Software.  Otherwise, You may also choose to use,<br>
distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under<br>
the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by<br>
the license steward.<br>
<br>
4.3. Modified Versions.<br>
<br>
When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new<br>
license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a<br>
modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license<br>
and remove any references to the name of the license steward<br>
(except to note that the license differs from this License); and<br>
(b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which<br>
differ from this License.<br>
<br>
5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.<br>

COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS"<br>
BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,<br>
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED<br>
SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR<br>
PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND<br>
PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD ANY<br>
COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE<br>
INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY<br>
NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  THIS DISCLAIMER OF<br>
WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE.  NO USE OF<br>
ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS<br>

<br>
6. TERMINATION.<br>
<br>
6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate<br>
automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to<br>
cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.<br>
Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond<br>
the termination of this License shall survive.<br>
<br>
6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding<br>
declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a<br>
Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You<br>
assert such claim is referred to as "Participant") alleging that<br>
the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where<br>
the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where<br>
the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly<br>
infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or<br>
indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if<br>
the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors<br>
under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days<br>
notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically<br>
at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within<br>
such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the<br>
Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally<br>
or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.<br>
<br>
6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,<br>
all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any<br>
distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses<br>
granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.<br>
<br>
7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.<br>
<br>
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT<br>
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE<br>
INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF<br>
COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE<br>
LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR<br>
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT<br>
LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK<br>
STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER<br>
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN<br>
INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  THIS LIMITATION OF<br>
LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL<br>
INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT<br>
APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO<br>
NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR<br>
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT<br>
APPLY TO YOU.<br>
<br>
8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.<br>
<br>
The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is<br>
defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial<br>
computer software" (as that term is defined at 48<br>
C.F.R. 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software<br>
documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212<br>
(Sept. 1995).  Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48<br>
C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all<br>
U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those<br>
rights set forth herein.  This U.S. Government Rights clause is in<br>
lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or<br>
provision that addresses Government rights in computer software<br>
under this License.<br>
<br>
9. MISCELLANEOUS.<br>
<br>
This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject<br>
matter hereof.  If any provision of this License is held to be<br>
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent<br>
necessary to make it enforceable.  This License shall be governed<br>
by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained<br>
within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law,<br>
if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's<br>
conflict-of-law provisions.  Any litigation relating to this<br>
License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located<br>
in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained<br>
within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible<br>
for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and<br>
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.  The application of the<br>
United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale<br>
of Goods is expressly excluded.  Any law or regulation which<br>
provides that the language of a contract shall be construed<br>
against the drafter shall not apply to this License.  You agree<br>
that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United<br>
States export administration regulations (and the export control<br>
laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,<br>
distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.<br>
<br>
10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.<br>
<br>
As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is<br>
responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or<br>
indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License<br>
and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to<br>
distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis.  Nothing<br>
herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission<br>
of liability.<br>
