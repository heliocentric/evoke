== Todo ==

 * installer needs to be able to install to a thumb drive.
    * Needs to disable/unmount all swap/filesystems on the target device node, if they are mounted/enabled.
 * 6.4 and 7.1 for i386 need to be on the image.
 * Add timezone support.
 * Bump the bootcode forward to 7.2 to fix some regressions.

== Warnings ==

Warning: Evoke now uses gzip to compress the kernel and all modules. There are reports that evoke is now unbootable on qemu, however, there are no reports of problems on real hardware. If you find any problems, we urge you to create a ticket in the issue tracker describing the boot problem.

== Features ==

=== SSH ===

Like the pilot, 0.1 supports ssh, however because evoke is currently single user, the ssh daemon is disabled. To enable it, add the following to /evoke/site.conf:

  evoke.sshkey="ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABI...."

Where the key is your public key. Currently, this method is an administrative interface that only supports a single public key. It is not recommended to use this feature in a pxeboot environment unless the hardware of both the boot server, the client, and all networking infrastructure is completely secured.

=== Install ===

Evoke supports a basic installer, intended for use with dedicated hard drives or thumb drives. Shared systems (with freebsd, windows, etc) are currently not supported with installer. This includes resizing partitions, adding boot menus, etc. Please do not use on those drives, thank you.

To access the installer, type:

  installer

And choose the 'Install Evoke' menu entry.

=== Update ===

Evoke now supports an update utility. To access, simply type:

  update

This will list your bootable filesystems, and allow you to choose the release to update to. If you want to specify a directory to update, type:

  update /directory

Caveat: The Activate menu entry only activates systems that boot directly off of the filesystem. Systems which are netbooted are not supported through this menu.
