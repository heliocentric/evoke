The system configuration utility stores all the configuration information in a round robin fixed length array of

sha256 for consistancy, and the most recent dated entry in the array is used.

== Feature List ==

 * create - Intializes the first sector, adding a uuid, the number of entries in the array, and a long description

== Required Files ==

 * /usr/local/bin/uuid - misc/ossp-uuid
