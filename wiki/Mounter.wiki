== Description ==

mounter is a way of mounting filesystems, be they remote or local, in a standard manner. Rather then burdoning the user with remembering what -o options specify the username, the password, port number; they are in a set format in mounter. We borrowed the url syntax, and adhere to it strictly. Also, we have support for automatic creation of md or ggate devices when a normal file is specified, and tearing down the md device when mounter unmount is used.
