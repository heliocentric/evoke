|| 0	|| No work has been done									||
|| 1	|| Data which is written to disk uses the format specified, but no programs truly 'use' it	||
|| 2	|| Evoke programs support it, but third party programs do not.					||
|| 3	|| Support is feature complete.									||

== General Platform ==

|| Description													|| Ver	|| #	||
|| Multiple installed versions. 										|| 0.1	|| 3	||
|| Multiple binary targets, including abis and architectures.							|| 0.1	|| 3	||
|| Single shared root filesystem.										|| 0.1	|| 3	||
|| Allow evoke to coexist with existing FreeBSD, PC-BSD, DesktopBSD et al installations.			|| 0.1	|| 3	||
|| Store system configuration information out of band of the boot filesystem, in a fault tolerant manner.	|| 0.1	|| 3	||
|| Split the released system files, from the site or machine specific files.					|| 0.1	|| 2	||

|| Use jails to segregate them.											|| N/A	|| 0	||

== User Interface ==

|| Description																	|| Ver	|| #	||
|| Replace a tty subsystem based around ioctls, with a generalized console daemon.								|| N/A	|| 0	||
