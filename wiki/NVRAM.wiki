== Description ==

The NVRAM partition contains all configuration information used by evoke. During system initialization, evoke gets 
a list of nvram partitions available, and allows the user to choose one if multiple are available, or default to 
the single one.

Current idea for implementation is a round robin array of gzipped tar archives with a static header section written 
at 'clear' time describing the nvram version, etc, and each element in the array containing a full contents sha256 
hash, and a timestamp. The most recent timestamp with verified contents is used.

The NVRAM is a user specific file; for terminals, the NVRAM is stored on a thumb drive. For infrastructure, it's on 
their disks, and is for the 'system owner'.
