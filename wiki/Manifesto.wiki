= Target Environment =

This is a description of the target environment of evoke. While we may not be able to implement it, we should not 
do anything to prevent it's implementation.


== Boot Server ==

Runs a dhcp and tftp server, and provides pxe boot functionality, or it's equivalent in other architectures. Key 
features are:

  * It boots off of the same drive that tftp then serves out for pxe functionality.
  * All configuration is kept in a seperate nvram partition/drive/etc.
  * The version of evoke the boot server boots is determined by it's boot.config. 
  * The version of evoke the clients boot is determined by the dhcp configuration, so the version can be host or network specific.

In this way there is one namespace for the evoke binaries, which can then be safely replicated.

== Installing New Hosts ==

Installing a new host should be as simple as enabling DHCP boot services, and uploading the boot server's public 
key into the firmware. This step is necessary to ensure that the boot code recieved by the dhcp server is signed 
and verified as being legitimate.

Once evoke has booted, it contacts the boot server to recieve it's configuration options, and changes the nvram 
partition (or creates one if it does not exist) to reflect any changes from the boot server.
